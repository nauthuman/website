		<i>THE FRANKENSTEIN EXPERIENCE</i> is an hour-long, immersive theatrical production that blends
      live theatre and audience interaction. You’ll walk the grounds where science and madness blur, 
		and witness the spark of life – and horror – ignite before your eyes. Test scientific theories
		with the Doctor and his demented Assistant, learn to love with the Creature and his Bride, and discover dark
		conspiracies with the Doctor's discarded failed Creations. 
		Whether you choose to interact or 
		simply watch the story unfold around you, every corner holds a secret waiting to be discovered. 
		Dare to enter the laboratory… and you may never leave again.
